# Data-Physics-Corrector
A physics enhanced deep learning architecture for solving stochastic differential equations. 
The "Codes" subfolder contains the ipython notebooks that contains the code. 
I order to reproduces the results, load the parameters from the subfolder "Saved parameters for the traine models" and run the codes block wise
